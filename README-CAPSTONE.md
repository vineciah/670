### Capstone Project 
### Social Media Comparison for Topeka's two biggest healthcare facilities:  Stormont-Vail Healtha and Univeristy of Kansas Healthcare - St. Francis Campus

I work for Stormont-Vail Health and one of our missions is to improve the health of our community. Stormont-Vail is aware of the importance of an online presence to connect with our patients and I am interested in comparing our reach demographics and integration versus our neighbor of University of Kansas Health Systems - St. Francis Campus. Knowing that our split has always been 70/30 for admissions within our serving area, does our Facebook presence reflect similar percentages?

I plan to include some of the mined data that I created for my Facebook homework and extrapolate to get additional details from each page. I may also do some Twitter mining to include additional statistical information.

I will extract information from Facebook and Twitter using the Twitter API as well as Netvizz, Facebooker, and Facebook developer python data mining.

GTM Analysis, Topic Analysis, Comment/Share/Like Analysis, Word Frequency, Visual Analysis, Sentiment Analysis.

My target will be our marketing department that manage our page as well as strategic planning. Is there any patterns of success that can be replicated and/or continued? Is there interactions that should be used less and/or avoided?
